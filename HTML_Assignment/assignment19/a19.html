      <h2>Mutual fund statistics</h2>
      <p>The first introduction of a mutual fund in India occurred in 1963, when the Government of India launched the Unit Trust of India (UTI).[1] Mutual funds are broadly categorised into three segments: equity funds, hybrid funds, and debt funds.
        The total Assets Under Management (AUM) of the Indian mutual fund industry as of December 31, 2023, stood at a staggering ₹50.78 trillion (US$600 billion). This is a significant milestone, marking over a six-fold increase compared to the ₹8.26 trillion (US$98 billion) recorded in December 2013.[2]
According to SEBI, during FY 2022–23, 73% of mutual fund units were redeemed within 2 years of investment. Only investments in 3% of the units continued for more than 5 years.[3][4]

      <section id="Franklin Templeton debacle">
        <h3>Franklin Templeton debacle</h3>
        <p>In April 2020, Franklin Templeton India unexpectedly wound up six credit funds with assets of close to $4 billion,
             citing a lack of liquidity amid the coronavirus pandemic. These funds had large exposure to higher-yielding, lower-rated 
             credit securities. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) conducted a probe into this sudden closure and found “serious lapses
              and violations”. As a result, in June 2021, SEBI barred Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund from launching any new debt schemes for two years.
               The regulator also ordered the fund house to refund investment and advisory fees, along with interest, of more than 5 billion rupees,
                and fined the global giant another 50 million rupees.[15][16][17][18]
Franklin Templeton said it strongly disagreed with the SEBI’s order and planned to appeal against it. The decision to wind up the schemes
 “was taken with the sole objective of preserving value for unitholders”, a spokesperson said. However, the closure of these funds sparked panic withdrawals from 
 other Franklin Templeton schemes as well as credit funds of other asset managers, leading to a storm on social media and court cases by 
 distraught investors.[18][15][17]</p>

      <section id="Reliance Mutual Fund">
        <h3>Reliance Mutual Fund</h3>
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dq7hb3fah/image/upload/v1758014100/Screenshot_2025-09-16_143846_n9hk9h.png">
        <p>In 2019, the debt schemes of Reliance Mutual Fund faced a liquidity crisis due to their exposure to troubled companies like Dewan Housing 
            Finance Corporation (DHFL). This led to severe redemptions and forced asset sales, which significantly affected investors.[19][20]</p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="IL&FS crisis and impact">
        <h3>IL&FS crisis and impact</h3>
        <p>The IL&FS crisis in 2018 had a significant impact on the mutual fund industry, including those managed by IDBI Mutual Fund.
             The defaults by IL&FS led to a series of downgrades and defaults on its debt obligations and inter-corporate deposits1.
             This situation caused considerable distress in the financial markets and led to significant markdowns in the Net Asset Values 
             (NAVs) of the affected mutual fund schemes, resulting in losses to investors.[21][22][23]
The defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) triggered a liquidity crisis, making it difficult for mutual funds 
to meet redemption demands without selling assets at distressed prices. This event heightened concerns about credit risk, leading to widespread
 downgrades of IL&FS and other non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). Consequently, the net asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these 
 securities were adversely affected, reflecting the increased credit risk and decreased market confidence.[24][25][26][27]

Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, particularly those with high exposure to NBFCs and infrastructure debt, was severely undermined. 
This led to significant outflows as investors moved towards safer and more liquid investment options. In response, the Securities and Exchange
 Board of India (SEBI) introduced stricter regulations on sectoral exposure, single issuer limits, and the quality of collateral accepted in debt funds
  to enhance liquidity and reduce risks. Fund managers began focusing on higher-quality assets and improved risk management practices. The crisis 
  underscored the need for better credit assessment and liquidity management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious investment approach
   within the mutual fund industry.[24][25][26][27]</p>

      <section id="Amtek Auto Impact">
        <h3>Amtek Auto Impact</h3>
        <p>Several mutual funds, including those managed by JP Morgan Asset Management India, faced significant issues due to exposure to Amtek Auto,
             which defaulted on its debt in 2015. JP Morgan had to suspend redemptions and impose exit loads to manage the liquidity crisis.[28][29][30]</p>
      </section>

      <section id="Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund">
        <h3>Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund(Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund)</h3>
        <p>In 2018, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund faced redemption pressures in some of its debt schemes due to exposure to entities like the Essel Group 
            companies. The Economic Times reported that the Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund was the biggest investor in the Essel Group, with an exposure of 
            Rs 2,936 crore spread across 28 schemes1. This accounted for almost 37% of the total debt fund exposure to the Zee group, which is part of the Essel 
            Group.[31]</p>
        </section>
      
      <section id="HDFC Mutual Fund">
        <h3>HDFC Mutual Fund</h3>
        <p>HDFC Mutual Fund did face a situation in 2018-2019 due to its exposure to companies like Essel Group and IL&FS. The credit events involving these companies 
            led to significant mark-downs in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of some of HDFC Mutual Fund’s debt schemes. This situation resulted in investor concerns
             and redemption pressures.[45][46]
To elaborate, the IL&FS crisis was one of the biggest financial crises in India, with the company defaulting on several of its obligations due to a cash shortfall.
 The debt involved was about Rs 1 lakh crore. Similarly, Essel Group companies were grappling with debt woes, which put mutual funds, including HDFC, under redemption pressure.
  However, HDFC Mutual Fund later recovered the entire investment made in the non-convertible debentures issued by Essel Group companies.[45][46]</p>
      </section>

      <section id="DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund">
        <h3>DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund</h3>
        <p>Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) defaulted on its debt obligations in 2019. This event led to significant governance concerns and defaults by DHFL 
            in meeting various payment obligations, prompting the Reserve Bank of India to supersede the Board of Directors of DHFL1. The default affected several mutual funds, 
            including those managed by BNP Paribas Asset Management India Private Limited, which had to mark down the value of their investments in DHFL’s securities.[39][40][32][35]
The crisis deepened with rating downgrades and write-offs by mutual funds, which had a cumulative exposure of ₹5,336 crore to securities issued by DHFL3. As a result, there was a
 severe liquidity issue and a drop in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the mutual funds, impacting investors’ returns. DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund, which was a joint venture between DHFL 
 and Pramerica Financial, Inc., also faced challenges due to the exposure to DHFL’s debt instruments.[39][40][32][35]</p>
      </section>

      <section id="Kotak Mutual Fund">
        <h3>Kotak Mutual Fund</h3>
        <p>In 2019, Kotak Mutual Fund did face challenges with its Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) due to exposure to debt securities of companies like the Essel Group. The fund house
             was unable to redeem investments from these companies, which led to delays and partial rollovers of the FMPs. This situation affected the investors’ expected returns. Consequently, 
             the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) barred Kotak from launching new FMPs for six months and imposed a fine for failing to abide by regulatory requirements.[44]</p>

    <section id="Market segment">
        <h3>Market segment</h3>
        <p>Despite being available in the market,[51] a recent report on Mutual Fund Investments in India published by research and analytics firm, Boston Analytics, suggests investors
             are holding back from putting their money into mutual funds due to their perceived high risk and a lack of information on how mutual funds work.[52] There are 46 Mutual Funds 
             as of June 2013.[53] In 2019, Asset under management (AUM) of the mutual fund industry rose by 13% to 24 trillion in 2018 by November[54] The total assets under management (AUM)
              has surged by around 23.43% in 2023. The Assets base in January 2023 was Rs.40.70lakh crores, which rose to Rs.50.24 lakh crore in Nov, 23.[55]</p>
