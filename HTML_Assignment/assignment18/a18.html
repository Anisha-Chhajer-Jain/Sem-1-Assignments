  <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth, recognized for their immense size, powerful trunks, 
    large ears, and distinctive tusks. These intelligent and social animals live in herds in the forests and grasslands of Africa 
    and Asia, using their versatile trunks to drink, eat, and communicate. As herbivores, they consume a diet of grasses, leaves,
     and fruits. Elephants possess strong memories and form close social bonds, demonstrating loyalty and emotional depth within their herds. </p>

<p>In the first chapter of my second book – Living The Simply Luxurious Life:
     Making Your Everydays Extraordinary and Discovering Your Best Self .However, luxury is a concept,
      not a concrete ‘thing’ that can be held in the hands or seen singularly as the same entity by all
       who pass by. Luxury is undefinable as a physical entity because it isn’t one thing, and it is 
       not a state of being you can buy or someone else can buy or give to you.</p>

        <p>The video you shared is a stand-up comedy bit by Amit Tandon about his daughter. Amit Tandon is known as “the married guy” of stand-up comedy because most of his humor comes from family life—his wife, kids, and middle-class experiences.
Father–daughter relationship.
He talks about how raising a daughter is both joyful and frustrating.
Small things daughters do at home turn into big comedy moments.
He compares his “old-school” childhood with his daughter’s modern lifestyle.
Overprotective father angle
He pokes fun at his own overprotectiveness when his daughter grows up.
Shopping with a daughter, arguments about clothes, makeup, or late-night outings.
How daughters emotionally blackmail fathers (“Papa please naaa…”).
Despite all the jokes, you can sense the love and pride he feels for his daughter.
That mix of affection + exaggeration is Amit Tandon’s signature style.</p>
  
        <h2>Wikipedia Article</h2>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer Science" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Despite the word science in its name, there is debate over whether or not computer science is a discipline of science,[49] mathematics,[50] or engineering.[51] Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon argued in 1975,
Computer science is an empirical discipline. We would have called it an experimental science, but like astronomy, economics, and geology, some of its unique forms of observation and experience do not fit a narrow stereotype of the experimental method. Nonetheless, they are experiments. Each new machine that is built is an experiment. Actually constructing the machine poses a question to nature; and we listen for the answer by observing the machine in operation and analyzing it by all analytical and measurement means available.[51]
It has since been argued that computer science can be classified as an empirical science since it makes use of empirical testing to evaluate the correctness of programs, but a problem remains in defining the laws and theorems of computer science (if any exist) and defining the nature of experiments in computer science.[51] Proponents of classifying computer science as an engineering discipline argue that the reliability of computational systems is investigated in the same way as bridges in civil engineering and airplanes in aerospace engineering.[51] They also argue that while empirical sciences observe what presently exists, computer science observes what is possible to exist and while scientists discover laws from observation, no proper laws have been found in computer science and it is instead concerned with creating phenomena.[51]
Proponents of classifying computer science as a mathematical discipline argue that computer programs are physical realizations of mathematical entities and programs that can be deductively reasoned through mathematical formal methods.[51] Computer scientists Edsger W. Dijkstra and Tony Hoare regard instructions for computer programs as mathematical sentences and interpret formal semantics for programming languages as mathematical axiomatic systems.[51]</p>
